## Overview
This project helped me develop hands-on experience in Business Intelligence using Power BI for Hotel Management and publishing my work on the cloud. I had never interacted with power BI before.

It is a unified platform for business intelligence that uses interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations to make data easier to understand.
