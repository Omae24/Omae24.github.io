## Overview
This project helped me develop hands-on experience in building a Linear Regression model using Python. I explored a dataset, trained and tested my model, and visualized my results.

## Objectives
- Exploring a real-world dataset
- Preparing and splitting data for training and testing
- Building a simple linear regression model
- Evaluating the model using key metrics
- Visualizing predictions and regression lines
- Publishing your project as part of your portfolio collection
