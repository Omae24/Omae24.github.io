## Overview
In this project, I built an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. The focus was on applying key concepts covered in class: preprocessing, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, pipeline construction, and model deployment.

The California Housing dataset is a well-known regression dataset that contains information collected from the 1990 California census. It is available directly through scikit-learn. 

## Objectives
- Load the dataset using fetch_california_housing.
- Apply preprocessing using ColumnTransformer
- Split the data into training and test sets (80/20 split).
- Define an evaluation metric: R² Score.
- Use a KNeighborsRegressor.
- Apply GridSearchCV to tune the following hyperparameters: n_neighbors: [3, 5, 7, 9] weights: ['uniform', 'distance'] p: [1, 2]
- Use 5-fold cross-validation.
- Save the trained pipeline using pickle or joblib.
