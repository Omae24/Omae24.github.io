## Overview
This project was on data wrangling. Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. The data source was from Kaggle. I developed hands-on experience on automating web data gathering using Kaggle Data Set and published my work on Kaggle. I practiced the data Wrangling concepts to clean up the Netflix dataset to a well-structured and usable format.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- datetime (Python standard library)
- Regular expressions (via pandas)
- Kaggle Notebook environment
- CSV files for data input/output

## What I Learned
- Load the Netflix dataset from a CSV file and explore its structure using pandas.
- Perform data discovery to assess data types, missing values, and quality issues.
- Clean the dataset by handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Transform and enrich the dataset using techniques like filtering, sorting, grouping, and feature extraction.
- Validate the final dataset by checking consistency, completeness, and logical accuracy.
- Export the final cleaned dataset to a .csv file ready for analysis or visualization
