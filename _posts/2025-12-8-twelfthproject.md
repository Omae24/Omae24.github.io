## Overview
In this project, I was to apply my understanding of Natural Language Processing

## Objectives
- Apply generative AI concepts to synthesize answers from retrieved document content.
- Extract key information from a PDF document by splitting it into chunks, embedding it using Sentence-Transformers, and storing it in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
- Demonstrate how retrieval improves generative question-answering by comparing answers generated from document-grounded context versus generic answers.
- Implement a complete RAG pipeline in Python using LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and FAISS.
- Practice prompt engineering to structure queries that guide the generative model for clearer and more detailed responses.
