## Overview
In this project, I was required to apply my understanding of Artificial Neural Networks and TensorFlow/Keras to build, train, evaluate, and document an image classification model using the MNIST dataset. 
MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a benchmark dataset widely used in training and testing machine learning and deep learning models for handwritten digit recognition.


## Objectives
- Preprocess and explore image data
- Design and build the ANN architecture
- Compile, Train, and Validate the deep learning model
- Evaluate the model on the test set and report the final test accuracy 
- Visualize model training history
- Save and load trained models using the modern Keras format
